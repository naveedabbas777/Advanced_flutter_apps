Modules of this app:

My Courses (previously Subjects): This module allows students to view the academic subjects they are currently enrolled in. They can see details about each course, such as its name and description.
My Tasks: In this module, students can see a list of all tasks assigned to them by their teachers. They have the functionality to mark these tasks as complete once finished.
Messages: This module facilitates communication between students and their assigned teachers. Students can view their chat history with their teacher and send new messages.
Reports: This module is designed to display various reports related to the student's academic progress, grades, or other relevant performance metrics. Currently, it serves as a placeholder for future implementation of detailed reporting features.
